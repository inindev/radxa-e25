Subject: [PATCH 3/3] board: rockchip: Fix SATA SSD Timeout

A timeout error was observed trying to boot with the following device:

KingSpec M.2 SATA SSD, 128GB 2242 SATA III 6Gbps Internal M.2 SSD,
Ultra-Slim NGFF State Drive
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CJF384F

Empirical testing reveals that ~1/4 second is needed to allow the device to power-up fully:

215ms:
=> setenv boot_targets scsi
=> bootflow scan
pcie_dw_rockchip pcie@fe280000: failed to enable vpcie3v3 (ret=-114)
scanning bus for devices...
SATA link 0 timeout.
AHCI 0001.0300 32 slots 1 ports 6 Gbps 0x1 impl SATA mode
flags: ncq stag pm led clo only pmp fbss pio slum part ccc apst
timeout exit!

=> setenv boot_targets scsi
=> bootflow scan

Target spinup took 0 ms.
